          <p>In New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment due to his various health and physical problems.
            Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about representing his country in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist again.
            He is finally recruited as part of a "super-soldier" experiment.
            <p>
              Colonel Phillips is unconvinced that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing him jump on a grenade to save his comrades, unaware that it is a test.
              Erskine reveals to Rogers that Johann Schmidt (Red Skull) underwent the procedure prematurely and suffered permanent side-effects.
              Eventually, Steve Rogers (now Captain America) fights Red Skull in an attempt to prevent him from using the Tesseract.
              The fight ends with Red Skull being teleported to an unknown place, while Captain Americais was forced to crush the plane he was on in the Arctic.
